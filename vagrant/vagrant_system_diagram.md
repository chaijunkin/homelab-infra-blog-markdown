# Use Case
My daily drive is Windows machine.
Vagrant is used to create a dev machine which using Linux OS in virtualbox. Currently, it is a lightweight VM built by bento, but I will migrate to linux desktop in virtualbox using Vagrant. A lightweight VM has not enough use case to cover my usage, example GUI application that only supports in Linux but not in windows.

# Command
vagrant box add debian-11.5.virtualbox
